The dataset that I chosen is happiness 2016-2017 dataset, one of Kaggle’s dataset. This dataset gives the happiness rank and happiness score of 155 countries around the world based on seven factors including family, life expectancy, economy, generosity, trust in government, freedom, and dystopia residual. Sum of the value of these seven factors gives us the happiness score and the higher the happiness score, the lower the happiness rank. So, it is evident that the higher value of each of these seven factors means the level of happiness is higher. We can define the meaning of these factors as the extent to which these factors lead to happiness. Dystopia is the opposite of utopia and has the lowest happiness level. Dystopia will be considered as a reference for other countries to show how far they are from being the poorest country regarding happiness level.

The purpose of choosing this work is to find out which factors are more important to live a happier life. As a result, people and countries can focus on the more significant factors to achieve a higher happiness level. We also will implement several machine learning algorithms to predict the happiness score and compare the result to discover which algorithm works better for this specific dataset.


**Definitions of each parameters

**Country**: Name of the country.

**Region**: Region the country belongs to.

**Happiness Rank**: Rank of the country based on the Happiness Score.

**Happiness Score**: A metric measured in 2016 and 2017 by asking the sampled people the question: "How would you rate your happiness on a scale of 0 to 10 where 10 is the happiest."
